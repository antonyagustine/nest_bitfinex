bitfinex:
  ☐ Use Nestjs framework to create the application,
  ☐ docs here https://docs.nestjs.com/

Use the following library in this application:
  ☐ https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bitfinex-api-node

It's docs here:
  ☐ https://cdn.statically.io/gh/bitfinexcom/bitfinex-api-node/master/docs/index.html
  ☐ Use it's WS2Manager class to subscribe to any public channel with any subscription data of your choice.
  ☐ Make more than 25 subscriptions, it should open more websockets connections to Bitfinex servers as single connection doesn't support more than 25 subscriptions for Bitfinex; and there shouldn't be any errors i.e.everything should keep working.
  ☐ It should close unused connections if any and there shouldn't be any memory leaks.
  ☐ Create a test script to automate such test and to validate the solution provided.
  ☐ You may use any library mentioned in Nestjs docs/examples or any widely known library which is upto enterprise standards.

NOTE: 
☐ no, I mean to say that make at least more than 25 subscriptions, you may use supporting pairs from here https://api-pub.bitfinex.com/v2/conf/pub:list:pair:exchange for testing.
☐ I expected you to have proper control over connection opening and closing.
